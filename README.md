# Best Practices writing a Dockerfile

Use non-root approach to enforce the container security!

## Main changes

Change the default user from `root` to `nonroot` (this user should belong to the `root` group to be compatible with arbitrary UIDs):

```diff
...
EXPOSE 80
+ RUN useradd -r -u 1001 -g root nonroot
+ USER nonroot
CMD ["node", "/app/server.js"]
...
```

Adapt the container to use alternative port such as `8080`:

- Dockerfile:

```diff
...
COPY --from=builder /tiller-proxy /proxy
- EXPOSE 80
+ EXPOSE 8080
USER nonroot
...
```

- server.js:

```diff
...
const serverHost = '127.0.0.1';
- const serverPort = 80;
+ const serverPort = 8080;
...
```

Give permissions to the group in the `/var/log/` directory (`nonroot` will be able to write since it belongs to the `root` group):

```diff
...
RUN useradd -r -u 1001 -g root nonroot
+ RUN chmod -R g+rwX /var/log
USER nonroot
...
```
